# GrayjayExportConverter

## Overview
**GrayjayExportConverter** is a Python script that converts YouTube data exported from the Android app Grayjay into file formats like those provided by Google Takeout. This enables users to import their data into other YouTube clients.

## Importing Data
The output files generated by this script have been specifically tested with:
- **LibreTube**: Subscriptions, watch history, and playlists are confirmed to work.
- **FreeTube**: Subscriptions and watch history have been successfully imported.

Compatibility with other applications has not yet been tested.

## Note on LibreTube
LibreTube uses **Piped** by default. Since Piped can sometimes be unstable or unusable, you may want to disable the Piped proxy in the **Instance** settings within the LibreTube app.

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the path to your Grayjay export file (ZIP or directory).

## Output
The converted data will be stored in a `converter_output` directory, which will be created in the same location as your input file.
